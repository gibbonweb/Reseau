Reseau
======

Let's see what we'll end up getting here.


Installation
============

Reseau is [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)-powered, which means that you'll need to install Flask, duh:

    sudo pip install Flask
    sudo pip install Flask-Markdown

What was so hard about this?

Running
=======

Execute

    python runserver.py
